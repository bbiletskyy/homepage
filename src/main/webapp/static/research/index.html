  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
  I study processes inside the living cell.
  Intracellular processes are driven by proteins.
  Proteins are very complex organic molecules performing a wide variety of functions inside the cell.
  Because of complexity of their function proteins are referred to as molecular machines or mechanisms.

  Each vital process occurring inside the cell is associated with a protein or a number of proteins.
  Cell produces proteins when some reaction is to be launched.
   
  Proteins are composed of 20 different building blocks called amino acids.
  Amino acids that protein consists of are ordered in a chain which is called protein primary structure. 
  The majority of proteins are about 100 amino acids in length.
  The amino acid chain entangles forming 3 dimensional structure called protein globule.
  Protein spatial structure defines its function in cell.
  The spatial structure of protein depends on the sequence of amino acids in its primary structure.
  So the amino acid sequence of protein defines its features.
  Assembling new proteins with given properties is very complicated problem, it has all properties of NP-complete problem.
